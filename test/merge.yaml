# Tests for yaml.jl handling of merge keys (<<:) and duplicate keys.
# 
# Merge key example from https://yaml.org/type/merge.html
# NB: merge keys would appear to be incompletely specified
# (a draft for yaml 1.1, not included in 1.2):
# https://ktomk.github.io/writing/yaml-anchor-alias-and-merge-key.html
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47168718/yaml-merge-level/
#
# yaml.jl 0.4.7 behaviour:
# - merge keys don't overwrite earlier explicit keys (as required by spec?)
# - multiple merge keys within <<: [ *BIG, *LEFT, *SMALL ] later don't overwrite earlier (as required by spec)
# - [not really merge,  but related]: duplicate keys are allowed, later keys overwrite earlier ones
# - [special case of 'duplicate keys allowed' ?]: multiple merge keys <<: are allowed, later ones override earlier ones
#  (surely a bug !)
#
# NB: quick test adding a haskey check before
#  mapping[key] = value
# in constructor.jl,  construct_mapping (line 193 in yaml.jl 0.4.7)
# shows it is not this simple (interacts somehow with merge keys and fails merging multiple keys)

- &CENTER { x: 1, y: 2 }
- &LEFT { x: 0, y: 2 }
- &BIG { r: 10 }
- &SMALL { r: 1 }

# All the following maps are equal:

- # Explicit keys
  x: 1
  y: 2
  r: 10
  label: center/big

- # Merge one map
  << : *CENTER
  r: 10
  label: center/big

- # Merge multiple maps
  << : [ *CENTER, *BIG ]
  label: center/big

- # Override
  << : [ *BIG, *LEFT, *SMALL ]
  x: 1
  label: center/big

# SD added: testing key yaml.jl key override and merge

- # SD added: testing merge keys respect earlier keys
  # yaml.jl merge keys don't override explicit keys
  r: 10
  << : *SMALL  # SMALL doesn't override r:

- # yaml.jl issue ? duplicates are allowed, and later keys override earlier ones
  r: 1
  r: 10

- # yaml.jl issue ? allows duplicate merge keys, and later ones override earlier ones !
  << : *BIG
  << : *SMALL  # SMALL overrides BIG
