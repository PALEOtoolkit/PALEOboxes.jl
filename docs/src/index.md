# PALEOboxes.jl


PALEOboxes.jl provides the model coupler for the PALEO model framework.

PALEO provides a toolkit for constructing biogeochemical reaction-transport models of Earth system components (eg atmosphere, ocean, sediment) as a well as coupled Earth system configurations.  Model structure as well as parameters are described by a configuration file, making it straightforward to add and remove biogeochemical tracers and their interactions, change the representation of eg ocean circulation, and couple components together.
